## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use the package manager PNPM, I really liked the way it organizes only the necessary modules, decreasing the volume in node_modules. 

For the first time I used a linter in my code, Eslint together with Prettier and Stylelint for Tailwindcss, I didn't get along at first with their strong opinion, but soon after I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to fix the syntax of the code manually.

I think my biggest challenge in the project was integrating a Vue3 library. In this case [*vue3-lazy-hydration*](https://github.com/freddy38510/vue3-lazy-hydration). As the name implies, it is a lazy hydration library. I had problems importing it so I opened an [issue](https://github.com/freddy38510/vue3-lazy-hydration/issues/36) and thanks to [@freddy38510](https://github.com/freddy38510) and [@dsvgl](https://github.com/dsvgl), I was able to use it.


## Optimizations

For the images I used the new *loading* parameters and set them to *lazy*. The goal is to improve performance by rendering only the visible images. [Read more](https://web.dev/i18n/pt/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/).

I also used the *vue3-lazy-hydration* library that uses the concept of lazy hydration with Vue3.
